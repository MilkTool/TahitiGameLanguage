Functions can be inherited from parent classes.
Child classes can write new versions of inherited functions.
Cannot over-write "final" functions in parent classes. This also results in faster code.
Functions are virtual by default so you can typecast classes to their base class and have
 the correct function called.
Variables can over-write those defined in parent classes. Variables cannot be virtual.
